# Tumor molecular heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) estimation
An exploratory project to investigate molecular treatment effect of gene expressions using observational The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA) data.

This project is based on the [Generalized Random Forest (GRF)](https://grf-labs.github.io/grf/) project by Athey & Imbens, but is now archived as a similar work has already been published by [Zhang et al.](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/15/2372/3089943). This repository will remain public FYR.
