## Outcome measures

Available outcome types according to TCGA-CDR publication:

> Using OS or disease-specific survival (DSS) demands longer follow-up times; thus, in many clinical trials, disease-free interval (DFI) or progression-free interval (PFI) are used (Hudis et al., 2007, Punt et al., 2007; https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/plugins/servlet/mobile#content/view/24279961)

DSS = 
> In cancer, the length of time after primary treatment for a cancer ends that the patient survives without any signs or symptoms of that cancer. [NIH dictionary](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/disease-free-survival)

DFI = 
> In cancer, the length of time after primary treatment for a cancer ends that the patient survives without any signs or symptoms of that cancer. In a clinical trial, measuring the disease-free survival is one way to see how well a new treatment works. Also called DFS, relapse-free survival, and RFS.
