Using standardized NNMIS script for this test as well

NAs found in clinical data set with enough stage information but some missing tumor status entries. We don't really need tumor status if we already have stage information in later HTE analysis, since the importance of having enough cases >>> having an extra covariate.

Stuck at PRAD files, because of naming issue?

    Error in coxph.pool(obj = impute_obj, time = outcome.x, status = OS, Z = dplyr::select(combined_os_exp,  : 
    object 'outcome.x' not found
    Calls: coxph.pool ... <Anonymous> -> model.frame.default -> eval -> eval -> <Anonymous>
    In addition: There were 50 or more warnings (use warnings() to see the first 50)
    Execution halted

We might have to separate BRCA and PRAD inputs.

=====================================================================
PRAD has naming issues with computing cox PH at line 97, because of column namings, so we will be running this line instead of that line 97 on the script:

            coxest = coxph.pool(obj = impute_obj, time = outcome, status = OS.x, Z = dplyr::select(combined_os_exp, all_of(sub_test_ensembl)), forceNumeric = FALSE, setRef = NULL)

Resolved by removing first few columns in the wds

=====================================================================
We shouldn't really use the scale by file method to deal with expression data for survival analysis.


=====================================================================
Batch effect may potentially affect your survival analysis, so we should do the correction. But we don't know if this is so important, we will try this on one cancer type and compare effects first.

Using lines 67-164 in the /home/alex/project/HTE/wd/HTE/Pathway_Score/Pathway_PROPS_scores.R script (by Larry), we obtained the batch effect corrected expression matrix with both normal sample and tumor samples. This is saved under the current directry as:

    "ComBat_corrected_FPKM_UQ_NT_and_TP.csv"

Using the resulting exp_matrix as the dataset for Cox PH model's covariates.

Using ComBat processed matrix resulted in very little significant covaraite gene, from 0.69 to 0.01 genes. Perhaps ComBat made tumor expression levels too similar, leading to such lost of information. We will proceed without using batch effect corrected expression data, while bearing in mind that there could be potential batch effects.



Removing line 81-88:

        wds = fread("ComBat_corrected_FPKM_UQ_NT_and_TP.csv")
        wds = as.data.frame(wds)
        wds = wds[grepl("-01[[:upper:]]-", wds$V1),] # select primary tumors
        # Separate samples into aliquotes and plates so that we can just pick one of those
        samples_barcode = separate(as.data.frame(wds$V1), "wds$V1", c(NA, "TSS", "patient", NA, "portion", "plate", "center"), sep = "-") # use NAs to skip variables you want to remove
        wds = cbind(samples_barcdoe, wds)
        wds = as.data.frame(wds %>% group_by(patient) %>% dplyr::slice(1)) # 11 out of 1100 samples were aliquot repeats for BRCA
        wds$donorId = format_tcga_patient(wds$V1)


Running script for univaraite gene results:

line 23, 27:

    test_files change to -> univaraite_test_files

line 28; 
    test_ensembl = test_genes$V1 change to -> test_ensembl = test_genes$Genes



=====================================================================

Completed both analysis and BN_valid.R is reverted to original script.
