# Overall project TODO list

## Parameter setting
- [ ] Test which proportion is best (with most genes passing perm test) without pre-selection
- [ ] continuous treatment
- [x] log2 transformation test: does it boost or dampen heterogeneity?
- [x] results for opposite vs in DEA treatment direction
- [x] install [warrenmcg/sleuth-ALR](https://rdrr.io/github/warrenmcg/sleuth-ALR/)

## Validation TODO
- [ ] Convert aligent using IQLR for technical concordant comparison
- [ ] re-reun expression external validation
- [ ] ext validation varimp overlap evaluation
- [ ] Gene set enrichment approaches [kloet2020](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008295)

### Compositional data
- [ ] Compare HTE results using IQLR transformed count matrix
- [ ] select covaraites/treatments based on 

## Results & Presentation
- [ ] update written method section
- [ ] write scripts to generate 'reports' for results you already have

## Additional supplementary tasks
- [ ] try X-learner with mutation data
