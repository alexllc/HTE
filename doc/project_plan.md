# Overall project TODO list

## Parameter setting
- [ ] Test which proportion is best (with most genes passing perm test) without pre-selection
- [ ] continuous treatment
- [ ] log2 transformation test: does it boost or dampen heterogeneity?
- [ ] results for opposite vs in DEA treatment direction
- [ ] install [warrenmcg/sleuth-ALR](https://rdrr.io/github/warrenmcg/sleuth-ALR/)

## Validation TODO
- [ ] re-reun expression external validation with varimp overlap evaluation
- [ ] Gene set enrichment approaches [kloet2020](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008295)

## Results & Presentation
- [ ] update written method section

## Additional supplementary tasks
- [ ] try X-learner with mutation data
